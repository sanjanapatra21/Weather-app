# Weather-app
This is a simple Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can enter a city name to get current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and more. This project is great for beginners learning how to work with APIs and build interactive web applications using JavaScript.
